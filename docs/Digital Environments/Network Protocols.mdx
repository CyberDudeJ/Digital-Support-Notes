# ⚙️ Network Protocols

import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

A communication protocol is a system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity.

### TCP/IP
**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol** <br />
- **TCP/IP**: A suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet and private networks. 
 - **TCP**: A connection-orientated protocol which establishes and maintains a connection until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. 
 - **IP**: The method that governs how computers share data across the Internet or private networks.
When a device sends data, such as an email or web form, its message gets parsed into smaller packets that contain the sending computers address, and part of the message.
