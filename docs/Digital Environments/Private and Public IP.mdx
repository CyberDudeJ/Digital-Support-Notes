# 🎐 Private and Public IP

import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

Addresses used on the internet such as for web servers and other network devices are known as **public IP addresses**. 

Public IP addresses need to be purchased for example when hosting a website or provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). 

With such a huge number of devices in private networks the use of public addresses would quickly extinguish the number of available IP addresses. 

To overcome this, a range of Private IP addresses were nominated as non-routable (cannot be used on a public network i.e. the internet) they are:
