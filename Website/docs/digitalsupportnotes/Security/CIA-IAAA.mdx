## CIA
In security terms, `CIA` stands for: **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability** <br />
These three principles form the cornerstone of any organisation's security infrastructure.

### Integrity
Integrity is about ensuring that data has not been tampered with and can be trusted. It is correct, authentic and reliable. <br />

Integrity can be compromised directly by methods including: <br />
**Deliberately** <br />
` - ` Tampering with intrusion detection systems <br />
` - ` Modifying configuration files <br />
` - ` Changing system logs to evade detection <br />

**Unintentionally:** <br />
` - ` Through human error <br />
` - ` Lack of care <br />
` - ` Coding errors <br />
` - ` Inadequate policies, procedures, and protection mechanisms <br />

#### How can integrity be ensured?
` - ` Encryption <br />
` - ` Hashing <br />
` - ` Digital signatures <br />
` - ` Digital certificates <br />
` - ` Intrusion detection systems <br />
` - ` Auditing <br />
` - ` Version control <br />
` - `  Strong authentication mechanisms and access controls <br />

### Availability
Things can jeopardise availability, including: <br />
` - ` Hardware or software failure <br />
` - ` Power failure <br />
` - ` Natural disasters <br />
` - ` Human error <br />

:::tip Example
The most well known attack that threatens availability is the denial of service attack, in which the performance of a systsm, website, web based application/service is degraded and the syste, becomes unreachable. 
:::

#### How can availibility be ensured?
` - ` Redundancy (in servers, networks, applications and services) <br />
` - ` Hardware fault tolerance (for servers and storage) <br />
` - ` Regular software patching 


### Availability
Availability means that networks, systems and applications are up and running. It ensures authorused users have timely, reliable access to resources when they're needed. 

## IAAA
This is **Identification, Authentication, Authorisation and Accountability** <br />
These are key concepts to understanding identity access management. <br />
