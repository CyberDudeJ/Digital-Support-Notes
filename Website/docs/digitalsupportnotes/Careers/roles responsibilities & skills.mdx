## Technical and Transferable

### Technical
These are skills that you develop that relate directly to a specific job role. <br />
For `example`, a Software Developer may have skills in Python or C# programming. <br />

### Transferable

Transferable skills are skills that you can apply to any profession, but usually the skills that help you `stand out` within your job role. <br />
For `example`, you could have excellent communication skills. <br />

Common `transferable` skills are: <br />
`-` communication <br />
`-` Creativity <br />
`-` Team working <br />
`-` Problem solving <br />
`-` Critical thinking <br />
`-` Adaprability <br />
