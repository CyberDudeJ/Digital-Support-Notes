There are many different planning tools you can used to plan a project. Some can be harder to understand than others, while a simple task list would be too simple (e.g. a task list doesn't show the dependencies a task requires).

=== Task List
A task list is simple. Its a list of the tasks, what's involved in them and a breif description of the task/s. This does not show the dependencies of each task (e.g. Before you pour the water to make tea, you must first get a mug and boil the water. In this case, boiling the water and getting a mug are the dependencies).
