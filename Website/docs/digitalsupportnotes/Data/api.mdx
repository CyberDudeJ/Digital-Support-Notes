# ðŸ”— API

import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

API stands for `Application Programming Interface`. It allows two applications to talk to each other. <br />


An example of an API is when you send a message on Facebook, Instagram or Whatsapp. <br />
Services like Zapier can handle API for you, making it easier for the end user. <br />

APIs are needed to help applications better communicate with each other and make tasks for us simpler to understand. It also helps with productivity. <br />

### Examples
Some common API examples include: <br />
` - ` Paying using your phone <br />
` - ` Google maps <br />
` - ` E-commerce <br />
` - ` Weather snippets <br />
` - ` Login using Google, Twitter, Facebook etc <br />
` - ` Holiday planning site <br />

### Types
**REST** <br />
Representational State Transfer <br />
The service is separated from the backend and the API will work wether it is communicating directly with a server. <br />



**SOAP** <br />
Simple Object Access Protocol <br />
Able to operate over a range of communication protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, TCP and more. <br />
It is also extensible and style-independent, which allows developers to write SOAP APIs in various ways and easily add features and functionality. <br />



**RPC** <br />
Remote Procedural Call <br />
Earliest and simplest form of API. It's about executing a block of code from another serverand when implemented in HTTP it can become a Web API. <br />
