Access control is a selective restriction of access to data. <br />

Basic explanation of each control measure:

### Physical Access
You need something physical to get in.  <br />

#### Pros
` - ` Need something physical to get in, no risk of writing passwords down

#### Cons
` - ` Could get stolen

:::tip Examples
` - ` Biometrics (FaceID, Fingerprint) <br />
` - ` Locks (Keys, RFID cards) <br />
` - ` Doors <br />
:::

### Remote access
Being able to access a computer system from anywhere in the world, from any device. 

#### Pros
` - ` Allows you to work from anywhere and pick up where you left off

#### Cons
` - ` Though hard to do so, connection could get intercepted eventually

:::tip Examples
` - ` VPN <br />
` - ` VCN <br />
` - ` RDP <br />
:::

### Permissions
This is where certain users have certain permissions, such as `edit`, `view`, etc. <br />
Setting up permissions based accounts ensures that the correct people have access to the correct things they need to complete their job. 

#### Pros
` - ` People are only able to do what they need to do. No risk of them doing something unauthourised

#### Cons
` - ` Someone must set it up, and that can be time consuming if there are many people

:::tip Examples
` - ` Write <br />
` - ` Read <br />
` - ` Edit <br />
` - `  Delete <br />
:::

### Authentication
Ensure users are who they say they are. This is an added level of security to ensure the identity of the accesser. 

#### Pros
` - ` Added level of security

#### Cons
` - ` Time consuming and frustraiting <br />
` - ` The authentication method (phone, token) could be lost or stolen

:::tip Examples
` - ` 2FA <br />
` - ` Capcha <br />
