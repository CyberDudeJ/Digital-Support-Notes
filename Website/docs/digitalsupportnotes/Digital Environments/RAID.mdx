# üóÑÔ∏è RAID

import { ReferenceLink } from '@site/docs/components/_nanos.mdx';

Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks **Or** Redundant Array of Independent Disks 

The utilisation of multiple hard drives as to provide data redundancy and improvments in performance. <br />

Combines multiple physical disk components into one or more logical units for the purpose of data redundancy, performance improvement or both.  

<br />

RAID exists as many different levels. Each one providing benefits dependent on hardware setup, e.g. <br />
- RAID 0
- RAID 1
- RAID 5
- RAID 10

:::tip Hardware or software?
RAID can be implemented as hardware or as software. <br />
Both setups still require multiple hard drives <br />
Hardware RAID requires a built in RAID controller card, whereas software RAID requires an operating system or utility that provides the RAID functionality

### RAID 0
- Often referred to as `striping`
- Uses two drives in conjunction with one other for speed
- Data is divided when it is written to both drives so that the workload is balanced, leading to it being more efficient
- There is no redundancy in this method
- Two identical drives should be used - Two different drives can be used, but at a cost. 
    - For example: If you have an 80GB and a 120GB drive, RAID 0 will have the machine treat them as two 80GB drives, ignoring the extra 40GB of space.
- A minimum of two drives are needed

RAID 0 is ideal for non-critical storage of data that have to be read/written to at high speed, such as on an image retouching or video editing station

#### Advantages
- Great performance, both in read and write operations
- Easy to implement 

#### Disadvantages
- If one drive fails, all data in the RAID 0 array are lost

### RAID 1
- Often referred to as `mirroring`
- Essentially a failsafe set up for a hard drive
- Two drives are set up so in effect all data is written twice
- If one drive fails, all data is preserved on drive two and the system will remain up and running
- Minimum of two drives are needed
- Two 100GB drives will mean you have 100GB of storage only
- Ideal for mission citical storage, example: Accounting systems

#### Advantages
- Excellent read speed and a write-speed that is comarable to that of a single drive
- If a drive fails, data does not have to be rebuilt, they just have to be copied to the replacment drive
- RAID 1 is very simple

#### Disadvantages
- Effective storage capacity is only half the total drive
- Does not always allow for hot swap

### RAID 5
