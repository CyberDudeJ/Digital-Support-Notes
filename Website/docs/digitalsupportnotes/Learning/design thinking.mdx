Design thinking is a methodology approach used to provide a solution to a design problem.  <br />
It is one of the more common approaches used when tyring to understand user requirments (human needs). Design thinking considers a problem in vaious ways from a user perspective and then creates as many ideas as possible, through techniques such as brainstorming. 

## Stages

`Stage 1` **Empathise** - Identifying user needs, Empathise with user <br />
`Stage 2` **Define** - Define the problem, Hypothesise, Map/challenge assumptions <br />
`Stage 3` **Ideate** - Create ideas that might solve the problem <br />
`Stage 4` **Prototype** - Prototype feedback loop, Conduct qualitive research with users <br />
`Stage 5` **Test** - Validate/disprove assumptions, Iterate prototype(s) based on research <br />

### Stage 4: Prototype
The purpose of this stage is to create a basic, cheap prototype that can be tested with a range of users to help identify any problems at this early stage.  <br />
Bear in mind, it is a lot easier to fix a problem at this stage rather than later when the full application is developed <br />
AT this stage, there might be multiple prototypes created to help identify which is best, what can be improved, what should be rejected or what needs further investigation. <br />
The prototype might be a flow based diagram or it could be a high fedility, interactive prototype created on specialised software. Like Adobe, Figma or Sketch. <br />


### Stage 5: Test
Designers try to regularly test their prototypes throughout the design stage. As errors are identified, the designers may link back to various stages in the process to resolver the problem. <br />
For examle: If the problem is a broken link, the designer will go back to the `prototype` stage and resolve the problem.  <br />
If the problem is related to the colour scheme (visual asthetics) then this might take the designer back to the `empathise` stage where they might need to reconsider the end user and gain further insight into the user needs. <br />
These changes are known as **`iterations`**

Iterations are used to continually improve a product prior to its release.
